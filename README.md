# Nebula Discord Bot


## About
Nebula is an open source Discord Bot currently being developed by @zephanrs. There are a variety of features, with more planned to be added later this year. You can use [this](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=777741089641463811&scope=bot) invite link to invite Nebula. 

## Current State
Nebula is still in early development. Expect long down times, and limited features. The bot is currently self-hosted, and will be until it is in a polished state.

## Contact
Feel free to add my discord `zephans#5657` if you have any questions or potential contributions.
